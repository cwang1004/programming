/*
	First part

	public means that it's something others can see and use
	private means that it's for your-self,only you can see
	static's oppisite is nothing
	return types -- int,String
	void means return nothing
	parameters go inside parethesis
	P.S:Susie is awesome
	and i reserched. 
	float is int but can have 6 numbers after the decimal point. 
	likethis: '1.234567'
	I guess so. I put the pic in the folder.

	Great work again! I was hoping at least one of you would research that.
	So float just means decimal numbers. It's not int anymore because ints are only whole numbers with no decimal points.
	But yes, the example you gave (1.234567) was of type float.
