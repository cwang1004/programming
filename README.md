# What is this?
 - Github repo for Susie and George and Neil's Java programming class.

## PvsPLN homework instructions (9/7):
 - mutiple prints vs mutiple printlns in your code.
 - go online and figure out how to make print do the same thing as println.

## Loopy loop homework instructions (9/14):
 - use for loop to loop 110 times.
 - in the loop, print out incrementing even numbers starting from 0.
 - ex. 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc.

## What a tough day! (9/21):
### First Part
 - Create a new file named Funnnnction
 - write a block comment and explain the following
 	- What is public?
 	- What is private?
 	- What is the opposite of static?
 	- What return types do you know? 
 	- What does void mean?
 	- Where do parameters go?

### Second Part
 - Create a static method that anybody can use, name it whatever you want
 - The return type of this method is float
 - This method has 3 int parameters, you can name them whatever you want
 - Return the value of the first parameter multiplied by the second parameter then divided by the third. 
 - ('\*' and '/' symbols do multiplication and division respectively)
 - Call this method with any 3 integers of your choice and print out the result in your main program.
 
### Third Part
 - Do a brief review of all the things we've learned (types, loops, prints, methods, +, -, *, /)
 - Experiment with different combinations of these things, mess around a little bit, make educated guesses.
 - You have learned enough about java to experiment on you own now. Time to let loose your curiosity.
 - P.S: you guys are more than welcomed to visit https://github.com/cwang1004/programming You can get a pretty neat look on all the     files 
```
Question (From Susie)
So * is multiplication and / is divide?
Yes!
```

## Starting Our First Game! (10/05):
### Time to Digest
 - We went over a lot of materials in class, including Scanner, conditional statements, while loops, and so on. So it is important that you take time to go over these materials time and time again. Start out by going over the program we wrote together in class. When you think you understand everything, write the program from scratch on your own. The most you are allowed to copy is the printPaper, printRock, and printScissors methods.
 - Pay attention to the 'nested while loops', think about what each while loop does? Why is our programming running forever? Why is input sanitization possible?

 Question(From Susie)
 You mean scrach? Make it on scrach? That orange cat? Or write the program again? Ummmmm,,, I don't have scrach... By the way...

### Answer the following questioins by block commenting in your program
- Neil, if you don't know how to comment, create a 'answer.txt' file and push that
- 1. Is Scanner a data type? Is it a primitive type or an object type?
- 2. What's the difference between a primitive type and an object type?
- 3. List 2-3 functions from the Scanner type.
- 2. List out as many conditional statements as possible.
