## Second Part
 - Create a static method that anybody can use, name it whatever you want

 - This method has 3 int parameters, you can name them whatever you want
 - Return the value of the first parameter multiplied by the second parameter then divided by the third. 
 - ('\*' and '/' symbols do multiplication and division respectively)
 - Call this method with any 3 integers of your choice and print out the result in your main program.
